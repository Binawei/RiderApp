## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Problem Statement

Modern software development faces significant challenges in delivering applications rapidly, reliably, and at scale. Traditional deployment methods suffer from manual processes, inconsistent environments, and lengthy release cycles that hinder business agility (Humble & Farley, 2010). Organizations require automated, scalable solutions that enable continuous integration and deployment while maintaining high availability and security standards.

### 1.2 Why DevOps Solution is Required

The need for a comprehensive DevOps solution stems from several critical business and technical requirements:

**Business Drivers:**
- **Time-to-Market Pressure**: Competitive markets demand rapid feature delivery
- **Cost Optimization**: Manual processes are expensive and error-prone
- **Scalability Requirements**: Applications must handle variable loads efficiently
- **Risk Mitigation**: Automated processes reduce human error and deployment failures

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Environment Inconsistency**: "It works on my machine" syndrome
- **Manual Deployment Overhead**: Time-consuming and error-prone processes
- **Lack of Rollback Capabilities**: Difficulty recovering from failed deployments
- **Infrastructure Management Complexity**: Manual server provisioning and maintenance

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This report aims to:
1. Design and implement a cloud-native DevOps pipeline using AWS ECS Fargate
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of containerized deployment strategies
3. Analyze the impact of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on deployment consistency
4. Assess the scalability and reliability of the implemented solution

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Implementation focuses on Java Spring Boot applications
- AWS cloud platform as the target infrastructure
- GitHub Actions as the CI/CD orchestration tool
- Terraform for infrastructure automation

**Limitations:**
- Single cloud provider implementation (AWS)
- Limited to containerized applications
- Focus on web applications rather than batch processing
